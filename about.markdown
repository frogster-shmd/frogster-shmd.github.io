## About

Thank you for visiting my page. I'm Foster. I currently reside in the Bay Area, and work at a water utility district as an Instrumentation and Controls Engineer Intern.

The title of this site "Digtal Craftsmen" was spurred from my interest in craftspeople. What draws me to crafts-people is their ability to create something that can be all at once be functional, practicial, and embodied with the character of the creator. I also envision their path to mastery being gained by time and effort less than an innate abilty to create what ever it is they make.

You will also notice that the plural form ("craftsmen") is used. I did this becasue I believe that you learn craft from others, and there have been many people along my path that continue to influence the craftmans I want to become in the digital landscape.

Idealistically this site will serve as inspiration for visitors. At the very least it will serve as a location where I can share the projects that I am working on. Most posts will be related to projects that are in progress, with finished projects titled as such.

The site is currently still in construction, but in a state I am willing to have visitors judge it. Some of the additions I would like to have are the following:
- local back button for navigation
- tags and categories for posts
- dates added above post titles on the post page
- learning more about best practices for `html` and `css` to clean the code up

#### The Site
This site is Hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using their [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) feature.

It utilizies the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.

The inspiration for styling came from the [hermit_zola](https://github.com/VersBinarii/hermit_zola) layout.
