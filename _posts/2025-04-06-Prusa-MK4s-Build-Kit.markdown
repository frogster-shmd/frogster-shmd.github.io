### Prusa MK4s Build Kit
Recently I purchased a Prusa MK4s, and becasue of my proclivity for cheapness I went with the kit. Now by no means are these printers cheap, but saving $200 and taking the time to assemble it myself seemed like a fair trade.

I will start by saying that I had only previously played around with other printers at my college campus, and had never built one before. Here are some of my thoughts and images from building the machine on my own.

This was after the first day of assembly, and there was only one worry that I had from the start. When I was younger I was known to over tighten bolts at times stripping threads, and tightening metal components housed in plastic gave me flash backs to hearing the crack of bolt from my youth. So I was weary just how tight I could go with these components. I settled on tightening enough, and then checking the tightness of the components after use. In reality this should probably be performed as routine maitenance.

Those zip ties in the image were also extremely hard to fit through the channels that they were supposed to slide through. They give you a 3d printed tool to help guide the zip ties, but it certainly kept me sweating trying to pull all those zip ties through.

The component in the above picture really amazed me. It was a piece of the X-Carrige assembly. The details on the part were just amazing so many flares, channels, and interference fits for nuts. There is also space for 3 bearings, and the X-Carriages belt that moves it. I think it was the most beautiful part of the whole kit.

Of course to finish off the build I enjoyed a Czech style Pilsner for a Czech Printer. Overall I would say it was a very pleasant experince. Prusa gives you ample extra parts and labels the bags when they do so. The hardest part was making sure I was confident in how I was tightening all of the components. Other than that it was an absolute joy the directions were very easy to follow. The build took me around two weeks working in the evenings for about an hour/two hours.

There will certainly be some 3d printed projects on the way here are a few ideas that are floating around:
- A monitor stand
- Indoor plant support 
- Enclosure for the printer
- A clamp to attach to something as a bike stand
